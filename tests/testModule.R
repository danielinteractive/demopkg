  app$get_screenshot()
  app$get_values()$input
  # Here we see the namespace being used!

  # We can also take screenshots of specific elements e.g. the plot.

  # But note that comparing these via testthat::expect_snapshot_file
  # can be tricky - as different computers will produce slightly different
  # graphs.

  # Release memory:
  app$stop()
})

# For a starting point to code the tests run:
record_test(app = "module")
